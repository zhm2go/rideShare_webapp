To start with, user could sign up account without verifying their email address and logging into the system without human-machine verification, 
leading to the following potential hazards:
(1)	A malicious user could pretend to be someone else and register account using other people’s email.
(2)	A malicious user could create a large amount of zombie accounts to occupy system’s memory and affect system operation speed. 
(3)	Since there is no human-machine verification, a malicious user could use machine to fake human and log into the system.
(4)	User can submit wrong email address without noticing. As a consequence, he/she may not be able to receive confirmation email.

Next, there is no privilege division between system users. This is especially vulnerable when using GET method to submit message to the sever.
 This is because a malicious user could elaborate the GET URL and try to access information belongs to other users. In this assignment, a logged-in 
user may use this kind of method and guess the Ride class instance’s primary key and combine the valid primary key into the URL to get information
 about another user’s ride without needing to join the ride.

The website is not support for resetting the password. This may cause great inconvenience if a user forgets his/her password. 

The sharer could join a share, and then the owner may modify or delete the order. It is tricky here. The ride owner could modify the destination, 
the arrival time or even whether this ride is sharable. If any of these is not in accord with the sharer’s need, he/she may need to select another 
open ride. To make it simple, we implement the following policy: once the owner modifies the order, the sharer will be dropped out immediately, 
unless the order is confirmed. The passenger number will be the sum of passengers from ride owner and all other sharers.

When filtering matched order by the driver's and orders' special information, we cannot just filter by special=driver's special. Users who do not have special information should also be added to the search result.
